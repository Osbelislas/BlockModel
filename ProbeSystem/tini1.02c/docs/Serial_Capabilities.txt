This file contains documentation on the serial communications capabilities 
of the TINI firmware and hardware.  TINI has two UARTs(serial port) on the 
DS80C390 processor and has the ability to also communicate with a 16550 
compatible UART.

Hardware
-======-

TINI is designed to support a total of four serial ports. The DS80C390 
processor has two built in UARTs.  These two UARTs will be referred to as 
the internal serial ports. TINI also supports communication with a 16550 
compatible UART. This will be referred to as the external serial ports. 
The driver for the external serial ports only supports addresses in CE
address space (Addresses using PCE signals are not supported).  

The internal serial ports now have support for hardware flow control and 
also support software flow control. TINI Rev. D or greater is required for
hardware flow control along with a socket board that supports this feature
such as TINI Socket E-series Rev. C or greater. 

The external serial ports have hardware flow control but no software flow 
control. These ports now make full use of their FIFOS which reduces CPU
load while streaming data.

See API_Changes.txt for newly supported javax.comm methods. 

Supported Modes
-=============-

The following baud rates are supported by the internal/external serial ports.

serial0/2/3 support baud rates of 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 
38400, 57600, 115200.  serial1 supports the same baud rates with the 
exception of 300, 600 and 1200. 

Internal serial0/1 support 7 or 8 bit characters. Even, odd or no-parity bit 
generation and detection.  With 8 databits, 1 stop bit is supported, with 
7 databits 2 stop bits are supported for no parity, and with 7 databits 
1 stop bit is supported with parity. 

External serial2/3 support 5,6,7 or 8 bit characters with 1, 1.5, or 2 stop 
bit generation. Refer to the National Semiconductor PC16552D data sheet for 
the external serial port modes. 

Testing
-=====-

Testing has been performed on all serial ports.  The primary testing has been 
done using a program that translates serial data to ethernet.  This testing 
has been performed using a baud rate of 115200 and transmitting all serial 
data received to a host computer which verifies that the serial data sent 
matches the ethernet data recieved.  Both serial0 and serial1 have been 
tested to 800,000,000 bytes successfully without flow control.  The external 
serial ports have been tested using hardware flow control at 115200.  The 
external serial ports can continuously sustain up to 38400 baud without flow 
control.
